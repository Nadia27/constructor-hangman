# constructor-hangman

Do you remember the classic game of Hangman? The age old classic game of guessing a word letter by letter, within a certain number of guesses.  The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, representing each letter of the word. If the suggested letter or number does not occur in the word, the guessing player is penalized. This continues until the guessing player guesses the word or "hangs" the man. 

 Now that we have that out of the way...

                    Welcome to Command Line Hangman!!!

Command-line hangman was built using constructor functions and a npm node package.  These package can be found on NPM (https://www.npmjs.com/).

         Download NPM package to get you started: 

         inquirer (https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)


In my version, the user's opponent will be the computer! The guesser is alloted 10 guesses. Upon guessing an incorrect letter the amount of guesses left is deducted by 1 until the user has no guess remaining.  If a letter is correctly guessed the amount of guesses remaining will not changed until the game is won! 

            Good Luck word hunting!!!
